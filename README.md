- 👋 Hi, I’m @saadpdm1995, Im making this Git so that other product managers can pick and chose completely written code to help them automate tasks
- 👀 I’m interested in creating a repo that is helpful to product managers
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript/React 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on automation scripts that help pdm

By the fall of 2021 I am looking to create a way for product managers to see requested code snippets, create pull requests and copy and use code out of the box!

If you are interested in this, or want to learn more, or just want to grab a virtual coffee/drink (depends on time of day) feel free to reach out to me!
